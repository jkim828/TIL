## **1. Interesting concepts that I learn todday** 

**Structured program theorem** <br/>
First published in 1966 by Corrado BÃ¶hm and Guiseppe Jacopini.<br/> 
It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem <br/>
developed by Stephen Kleene. <br/> 

A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task.<br/> 
According to the structured program theorem, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways <br/>
to get any larger task done.<br/>
1. in sequence
2. by selection
3. in repetition


**Voronoi diagram named after Georgy Voronoi** <br/>
In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points <br/>
in a specific subset of the plane.That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, <br/>
and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. <br/>
These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual <br/>
to its Delaunay triangulation. <br/>
